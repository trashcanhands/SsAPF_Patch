If you use the original ModShardLauncher: <br>
Download Autopathfinder_Patch.sml, install the mod as usual. <br>
<b><i>Make sure you put the patch after the Autopathfinder mod in your MSL load order.</i></b> <br>
<br>
If you use ModShardLauncher-Enhanced: <br>
Download Autopathfinder_Standalone.sml, install the mod as usual. <br>
<b><i>The MSL-E Standalone version does not require the original Autopathfinder mod.</i></b> <br>

Note: One caveat with MSL-E that I could not get around is getting continuous pathfinding to work, so you will have to hit your pathfind hotkey again each time you transition to a new tile.
